I am an applied health policy researcher with interdisciplinary training in decision science, epidemiology, and data science. I build computational models to synthesize data, evaluate tradeoffs, and ultimately inform policies that address population health challenges.

My research focuses on 1) quantifying population-level disease burden and health disparities, and 2) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies to reduce disease burden and promote health equity. My research has spanned global epidemiology of non-communicable disease risk factors, addressing disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in the US and California, developing agent-based network models to quantify the impacts of harm-reduction interventions for people who inject drugs, and simulation analyses of policies to control prescription drug prices.

I am in my fifth year of the Health Policy PhD program in the [Department of Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Joshua Salomon](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/joshua-salomon), [Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jeremy_goldhaberfiebert), and [Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/). I will be on the academic job market for positions starting in 2024.
