I am an applied health policy researcher with interdisciplinary training in decision science, health services research, epidemiology, and data science. I develop computational models to quantify disease burden, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and promote evidence-based policies and programs across a range of priorities in public health, with a focus on health equity. I am in my fifth year of the Health Policy PhD program in the [Department of Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Joshua Salomon](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/joshua-salomon), [Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jeremy_goldhaberfiebert), [Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/), and [Michelle Mello](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/michelle-m-mello/). I am on the academic job market for positions starting in 2024.

Before starting my PhD training, I worked for five years at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/) at the University of Washington. At IHME, I developed expertise in describing and prioritizing public health issues. I decided to pursue a PhD in Health Policy and Decision Science to develop a complementary skillset focused on identifying and evaluating solutions to these issues.

My research aims to provide policymakers with the evidence they need to address major threats to public health and health equity. I have worked on the global epidemiology of non-communicable disease risk factors, addressing disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, developing a syndemics-focused agent-based network model of HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs, improving the timeliness and spatial resolution of population health surveillance, prescription drug pricing policies, and improving healthcare access and outcomes for the Medicare population.

My long-term agenda focuses on 1) modeling syndemics of chronic and infectious diseases, 2) improving population health surveillance systems, and 3) developing research-practice partnerships to translate research into policy impact. If you’re interested in my work, share interests, or want to collaborate, don’t hesitate to reach out.
