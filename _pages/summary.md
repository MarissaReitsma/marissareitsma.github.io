I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Department of Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Joshua Salomon](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/joshua-salomon), [Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jeremy_goldhaberfiebert), and [Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/). My research focuses on applied health policy and intervention modeling to reduce disease burden and promote health equity. This involves descriptive analyses of health disparities, building prospective simulations, and conducting retrospective evaluations of policy changes and interventions. My research focuses on: COVID-19, infectious disease dynamics and network epidemiology, fairness in plan payement risk adjustment, pharmaceutical drug pricing, and tobacco control (I get excited about a lot of topics!).

### Summary of Research Areas

1. COVID-19: 

2. Infectious Disease Dynamics and Network Epidemiology

3. Fairness in Plan Payment Risk Adjustment

4. Pharmaceutical Drug Pricing

5. Global Tobacco Control and other Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors: Prior to Stanford, I worked for five years at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation on the Global Burden of Disease Study. I modeled multiple non-communicable disease risk factors, including smoking, obesity, and alcohol use. I developed new direct estimation methods for smoking attributable burden from 36 health outcomes that reflect dose-response associations among both current and former smokers. With colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, I continue to work on forecasting smoking attributable burden under status quo and alternative policy scenarios. I am also engaged in ongoing research on global hypertension screening and treatment through the Global Health and Population Project on Access to Care for Cardiometabolic Diseases (HPACC) research consortium.
