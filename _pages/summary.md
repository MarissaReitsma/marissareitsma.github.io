I am a PhD student in the [Department of Health Policy](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, advised by [Joshua Salomon](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/joshua-salomon), [Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jeremy_goldhaberfiebert), and [Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/). My research focuses on applied health policy and intervention modeling to reduce disease burden and promote health equity. This involves descriptive analyses of health disparities, building prospective simulations, and conducting retrospective evaluations of policy changes and interventions. I have focused on a wide array of topics, ranging from COVID-19 to pharmaceutical drug pricing to tobacco control [(more)](/about).
