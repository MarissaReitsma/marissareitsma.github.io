## COVID-19
***Work with Joshua Salomon, Sherri Rose, and Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert***

## Infectious Disease Dynamics and Network Epidemiology
***Work with Joshua Salomon, Benjamin Linas, and Lin Zhu***

## Fairness in Plan Payment Risk Adjustment
***Work with Sherri Rose***

I am in the early stages of a project focusing on improving efficiency and fairness in Medicare plan payment risk adjustment. The overarching goal of this project is to provide policymakers with tools for uncovering incentives for selection in insurance markets and concrete evidence that specific changes to the existing formulas can deliver a path towards more equitable health coverage.

## Pharmaceutical Drug Pricing
***Work with Michelle Mello, Jeromie Ballreich, Stacie Dusetzina, and Antonio Trujillo***

I am currently working on simulating the effects of policies to improve affordability of prescription drugs. Policies include Medicare price negotiation and penalties for unsupported price increases.

## Global Tobacco Control
***Work with Emmanuela Gakidou and colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation***

I previously worked for five years at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation on the Global Burden of Disease Study. I modeled multiple non-communicable disease risk factors, including smoking, obesity, and alcohol use. I developed new direct estimation methods for smoking attributable burden from 36 health outcomes that reflect dose-response associations among both current and former smokers. With colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, I continue to work on forecasting smoking attributable burden under status quo and alternative policy scenarios. 

## Global Hypertension Screening and Treatment
***Work with Pascal Geldsetzer***

I am engaged in ongoing research modeling global hypertension screening and treatment through the Global Health and Population Project on Access to Care for Cardiometabolic Diseases (HPACC) research consortium.
