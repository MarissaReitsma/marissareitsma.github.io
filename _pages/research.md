## Global Tobacco Control
***Work with Emmanuela Gakidou and colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation***

Prior to Stanford, I worked for five years at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation on the Global Burden of Disease Study. I modeled multiple non-communicable disease risk factors, including smoking, obesity, and alcohol use. I developed new direct estimation methods for smoking attributable burden from 36 health outcomes that reflect dose-response associations among both current and former smokers. With colleagues at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, I continue to work on forecasting smoking attributable burden under status quo and alternative policy scenarios. 

## Global Hypertension Screening and Treatment
***Work with Pascal Geldsetzer***

I am engaged in ongoing research modeling global hypertension screening and treatment through the Global Health and Population Project on Access to Care for Cardiometabolic Diseases (HPACC) research consortium.
