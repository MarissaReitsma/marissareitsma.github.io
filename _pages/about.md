My research focuses on applied health policy and intervention modeling to reduce disease burden and promote health equity. This involves descriptive analyses of health disparities, building prospective simulations, and conducting retrospective evaluations of policy changes and interventions. I often deal with missing and noisy data, and an important part of my work involves creating visualizations and other tools to effectively communicate results with policymakers and the public. I have focused on a wide array of topics, ranging from COVID-19 to pharmaceutical drug pricing to tobacco control.
